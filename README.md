# Bitmap Image Viewer

## Description

This is a simple bitmap image viewer written in python using the Qt framework. It's a part of my YouTube channel video about understand the bitmap image format.

This is just a proof of concept, it's not meant to be used as a real image viewer. I encourage you to rewrite your own image viewer on what ever programming language you want. Use this as a reference.

## How to run

You need to have python 3.6 or newer installed on your system. You also need to install the PyQt5 library. You can do that by running the following command:

I would recommend using a virtual environment for this.

example:
```
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```


```
pip install PyQt5
```

copy 500px x 500px bitmap image to the same directory as the program and name it "image.bmp"

After that you can run the program by executing the following command:

```
python bitmap.py
```
